**IV. ITIL Incident Management:**
**- What is Incident Management:**
An incident is an event that may result in the loss or disruption of an organization’s operations, services or functions. Incident management (ICM) is a term that describes an organization’s activities to identify, analyze, and remediate hazards to prevent them from occurring again in the future.

These events within a structured organization are normally handled by an incident response team (IRT), an incident management team (IMT), or the Incident Command System (ICS). Without effective incident management, an incident can disrupt business operations, information security, IT systems, employees, customers, or other vital business functions.

Without incident management, you could lose valuable data, gain low productivity and revenue due to downtime, or be held liable for breaches of service level agreements (SLAs). Even when incidents are insignificant and cause no lasting damage, IT teams should devote valuable time to investigating and fixing problems.

Some of the most important benefits of implementing an incident management strategy include:
1. Prevention of incidents
2. Improved mean time to resolution (MTTR)
3. Reducing or eliminating downtime
4. Higher data accuracy
5.Improved customer experience

Another benefit of incident management applications is an overall reduction in costs. According to a study by Gartner, system or service downtime can cost organizations up to $ 300,000 per hour. Additionally, legal fines and loss of customer trust can have significant financial implications. With incident management, organizations may have to invest upfront, but avoid significant costs later on.

**- The classic incident management activities as outlined in ITIL 4 are:**

Successful incident management relies on having a clear understanding of what the customer agreed to or is willing to tolerate regarding the duration and handling of any particular incident. This is usually defined in service level agreements (SLAs) or contracts, which include timelines for responding and resolving incidents based on some criteria, usually priority, as a function of impact and urgency.

**- Create an Incident Management Workflow (AKA An Incident Life Cycle):**

**- Standardize Root Cause Analysis (RCA) and Prioritization:**

**- Operational incident management requires several key pieces:**

A service desk is divided into tiers of support: L1, L2, L3, etc.

**L1:**
The first tier is for basic issues, such as password resets and basic computer troubleshooting. Tier-one incidents are most likely to turn into incident models, since the templates to create them are easy and the incidents recur often. For example, a template model for a password reset includes:
    The categorization of the incident (category of “Account” and type “Password Reset”, for example)
    A template of information that the support staff completes (username and verification requirements, in this case)
    Links to internal or external knowledge base articles that support the incident.
Low-priority tier-one incidents do not impact the business in any way and can be worked around by users.

**L2:**
Second-tier support involves issues that need more skill, training, or access to complete. Resetting an RSA token, for example, may require tier-two escalation. Some organizations categorize incidents reported by VIPs as tier two to provide a higher quality of service to those employees. Tier-two incidents may be medium-priority issues, which need a faster response from the service desk.

**L3:**
Correct assignment of tiers and priorities occurs when most incidents fall into tier one/low priority, some fall into tier two, and few require escalation to tier three. Those that require urgent escalation become major Incidents, which require the “all hands on deck” response.
Major incidents are defined by ITIL as incidents that represent significant disruption to the business. These are always high priority and warrant immediate response by the service desk and often escalation staff. In the tiered support structure, these incidents are tier three and are good candidates for problem management.
