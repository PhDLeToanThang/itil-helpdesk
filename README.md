**I. IT Asset Management:**

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/106635733/200490739-c669d256-87fc-4e20-a51c-97d70ad2d48f.png)
IT organizations manage a large amount of the company’s total assets. IT assets are extremely costly to manage and maintain. As a result, asset management plays a major role in helping organizations in fulfilling the requirements of users and business functions.

IT asset management (ITAM) provides an accurate account of technology asset lifecycle costs and risks to maximize the business value of technology strategy, architecture, funding, contractual and sourcing decisions.”

This definition points out that ITAM is not just about collecting the assets, it is not just about carrying assets, it is about using the right information at the right time that is obtained to drive better decision making. This ITAM software will be the best solution that helps businesses in focusing on the informational value of IT asset data to get the best business value.

Asset tracking system is an important part of an IT organization, as it ensures that companies have control over their applications and hardware, have a complete overview of the assets, where they are being used, and how often they are being used.

**- IT Asset Management and ITIL:**
ITIL and asset management is a partnership ensuring you’re planning and managing the relationships between your IT assets and service tickets or requests. The ITIL framework is a set of best practices providing the foundation for better IT service management (ITSM). Incorporating the best practices of ITIL gives you the ability to manage your IT assets in real time with a full understanding of how incidents, problems, changes, and releases impact your assets through an integrated service desk. IT asset management solutions coupled with ITIL best practices reduce business risk by alerting IT of potential software security problems and threats.
The goals of ITIL and asset management software include:
  1. Acquiring appropriate IT assets while keeping costs low and benefits high
  2. Optimizing the use of each IT asset
  3. Disposing of IT assets when cost of maintaining them exceeds their benefits
  4. Providing information necessary for regulatory compliance, license renewal, and contract renewal

ITIL asset management allows for more effective incident and problem management, which can improve resolution rates and reduce resolution times. It also makes it easier to move, add, or change configurations by connecting service information to specific assets. A good asset management strategy makes it easier to track software licenses and warranties so that your business can avoid unnecessary repair charges or fines for breaching service level agreements (SLAs). This helps keep ITSM costs down.

**- Benefits of Asset Management Solutions:**
IT asset management (ITAM) software allows businesses to:
  1. Manage asset compliance
  2. Have greater asset visibility
  3. Increase accountability
  4. Reduce unnecessary purchases
  5. Redeploy IT assets quicker
  6. Manage contract service levels

  8. Improve budgeting
  9. Improve management of depreciable assets
  10. Reduce payments made due to ignorance of warranty status
  11. Better measure and control IT costs
  12. Manage every asset from requisition through retirement

The IT asset management software benefits greatly from being as automated as possible. Track and tag hundreds of different hardware properties, software titles, and user and location history from your Windows, iOS, and Chrome OS devices. Save time and keep records up to date in a single location by compiling vendor data, warranties, lease terms, and agreements. Expedite break-fixes and changes within service desk tickets by automatically capturing and gathering each asset’s incident history.

**II. ITIL Knowledge Management | ITIL Foundation | ITSM:**

**What is ITIL Knowledge Management Process?**
The Knowledge Management **(KM)** or Knowledge Base **(KB)** Process is one of the main processes under Service Transition module of the ITIL Framework.
As described in ITIL v4 documentation, it is the process of creating, sharing, using and managing the knowledge and information of an organization.
The ITIL Knowledge Management Process helps the organizations to achieve their goals by making the best use of knowledge. Many large companies already have dedicated teams for managing organizational knowledge.

**ITIL Knowledge Management Scope:**
ITIL Knowledge Management (**ITIL KM** or **ITIL KB**) is the central process that receives input from all other ITSM processes and responsible for providing supporting knowledge to all of the ITSM processes when required. Hence, it is defined that this process interacts with every other process of the IT Service Management (ITSM) Framework.

**ITIL Knowledge Management Objective:**
The primary objective of ITIL Knowledge Management Process is to collect, analyze, store and share knowledge and information within an organization. It also reduces the need for rediscovering knowledge, hence improves the service efficiency.
This process is also responsible for maintaining the service knowledge management system (ITIL SKMS or ITIL KBs), which symbolizes the total body of knowledge within the organization. Here the objective is to capture, arrange, classify, and store every bit of organizational knowledge and made them available where needed.

**Benefits of Using ITIL Knowledge Management:**
  By implementing knowledge management (ITIL V4) practices in your organization, you can improve the IT team's overall capability and provide better service to users. Some of the benefits of this process are:

  Reductions the amount of time that must be spent on training employees. Since your team will consistently receive precise and up-to-date information, they will require fewer formal training to meet the performance expectations.

  Decreases the number of errors that are made by team members. If your team has the adequate source of knowledge that is needed to take formal decisions, then they are far less likely to go outside the track.

  Implementation of the ITIL Knowledge Management process cuts down the effort to complete any steps of the service process more than once. When everyone would have process awareness, it is less likely that a known step will be performed incorrectly.

  Availability of instant knowledge allows the IT professionals to respond to customer demands faster and more effectively. Your employees will know the way to answer customer questions more efficiently, thus reducing the number of times you have to intervene or respond to a negative feedback about the lack of knowledge of your team members.

  The relevant part of knowledge stored in the SKMS can be made available to the end user by creating a user portal. Thus creating a self-help service desk portal for common users. This can significantly decrease the pressure on the service desk associates, which will eventually increase the quality of service.

**The DIKW Model of ITIL Knowledge Management:**
The DIKW Model (also known as DIKW Pyramid, DIKW Hierarchy, Data pyramid, Knowledge Hierarchy) is a hierarchical model for representing the flow of data through information, knowledge, and wisdom.

In this model, the “D” stands for Data, “I” stands for Information, “K” stands for Knowledge, and “W” stands for Wisdom. The reference model has been shown below:
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/106635733/200509174-eaad21bb-23b9-4dab-bacd-7b7f24a8d676.png)

**Data:** Data is the collection of discrete facts about events, received as inputs from the processes. Data basically consists of symbols or signs, representing stimuli or signals that are of no use until processed.

**Information:** Information is processed data. It comes from providing context to data or by asking questions on the data. This typically requires capturing of various sources of data and applying some meaning or relevance to the set of facts. Information tries to answer the question “Who? What? When? Where?”.

**Knowledge:** Knowledge is a more derived form of data. It is composed of the concepts, experiences, ideas, insights values and judgments of individuals with a clear reference to the information. This usually requires the analysis of information and helps in decision making. Knowledge tries to answer the question “How?”.

**Wisdom:** Wisdom gives the ultimate insight of the data. It describes the application of knowledge and provides contextual awareness to generate a strong common sense judgment. The use of wisdom enables an organization to manage its strategy and growth in competitive market spaces. Wisdom tries to answer the question “Why?”.

**What is Service Knowledge Management System (SKMS) or SKBs in ITIL?**
As defined in ITIL v4, the Service Knowledge Management System (SKMS) or SKBs is the central repository of the data, information, and knowledge that the IT organization needs to manage the lifecycle of its services.

The SKMS/SKBs is not necessarily to be a single system and usually formed by merging multiple discrete systems & data sources.
The main purpose of SKMS (ITIL V4) is to store, analyze and present the service provider's data, information and knowledge in a structured manner.

**The Relationship between CMDB, KEDB, CMS, and SKMS:**
The SKMS/ SKBs is closely related to CMDB, KEDB, and CMS. These act as three levels of data processing.
The CMDB captures & record the configuration data and KEDB Records Known errors, the CMS arranges these records in a manageable structure and then that processed information feeds into the SKMS/SKBs.
Using these stored information SKMS/SKBs supports delivery of the services and helps to provide relevant information for decision-making. Below Image describes the relationship among them:

**ITIL Knowledge Management Activities:**
The knowledge management (ITIL V4) process has some defined activities that needs to be performed for its successful implementation, those are:

_**1) Knowledge Management Strategy:**_
Your organization must have defined strategy for identifying the information that needs to be processed by ITIL Knowledge Management process. Your strategy should clearly identify the types of information that need to be passed to the knowledge management.
You may choose any parameter as per your business requirement, but all of these strategic identifiers should have been documented to ensure that every team member understands what is expected.
For example, A lot of organization describes the feedback from customers, repeated incident reports, and the support costs as key data that needs to be analyzed by this process.

_**2) Knowledge Transfer:**_
Once you have decided your strategy, you will have to determine the process on how the knowledge will be transferred to other team members or departments.
The initial step in knowledge transfer activity is identifying the communication gaps so that you can eliminate them before transferring the knowledge to all the concerned stakeholders.
It is absolutely necessary to create a well-defined communication plan for circulating information across all channels during this activity.

_**3) Information Management:**_
Information can only become knowledge if it is properly processed, managed, and distributed across your team. Instant access to the specific and relevant information is also essential for the success of the ITIL Knowledge Management process.
Information management activity is a critical part of the whole process that involves data collection, information management, and determining how this information will be translated to become the knowledge. You should first define a process to organize this information and then record it in a manual as a policy or procedure, so that your team members can access it as and when needed.

_**4) Management of SKMS:**_
We already know that the ITIL SKMS / ITIL SKBs is a group of systems, tools, and databases needed for successful implementation of knowledge management. This is the system you should use to store, update, and manage data on a regular basis.
Your team members should have the appropriate right to access information through the SKMS/ SKBs system at any point in time. So, the management of SKMS/SKBs  should have the maximum importance for an organization.
ITIL Knowledge Management Sub-Process: 
There is no defined sub-process of this process. Refer to the below diagram describing the ITIL Knowledge Management Process Flow:
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/106635733/200513424-e02b69c3-606b-4ae7-934f-11171540ccf5.png)

**ITIL Knowledge Management Roles and Responsibilities:**
_**Knowledge Manager:**_
    This Knowledge Manager role is the Process Owner of this ITIL Knowledge Management Process.
    Knowledge Manager ensures that the IT organization is able to collect, analyze, store and share knowledge and information as and when required.
    The primary goal of Knowledge Manager is to improve efficiency by reducing the need to rediscover knowledge.


**IV. ITIL Incident Management:**

**- What is Incident Management:**

An incident is an event that may result in the loss or disruption of an organization’s operations, services or functions. Incident management (ICM) is a term that describes an organization’s activities to identify, analyze, and remediate hazards to prevent them from occurring again in the future.

These events within a structured organization are normally handled by an incident response team (IRT), an incident management team (IMT), or the Incident Command System (ICS). Without effective incident management, an incident can disrupt business operations, information security, IT systems, employees, customers, or other vital business functions.

Without incident management, you could lose valuable data, gain low productivity and revenue due to downtime, or be held liable for breaches of service level agreements (SLAs). Even when incidents are insignificant and cause no lasting damage, IT teams should devote valuable time to investigating and fixing problems.

Some of the most important benefits of implementing an incident management strategy include:
 1. Prevention of incidents
 2. Improved mean time to resolution (MTTR)
 3. Reducing or eliminating downtime
 4. Higher data accuracy
 5.Improved customer experience

Another benefit of incident management applications is an overall reduction in costs. According to a study by Gartner, system or service downtime can cost organizations up to $ 300,000 per hour. Additionally, legal fines and loss of customer trust can have significant financial implications. With incident management, organizations may have to invest upfront, but avoid significant costs later on.

**- The classic incident management activities as outlined in ITIL 4 are:**

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/106635733/200486582-c14f6fe6-e378-470a-86cf-848139648bc5.png)

Successful incident management relies on having a clear understanding of what the customer agreed to or is willing to tolerate regarding the duration and handling of any particular incident. This is usually defined in service level agreements (SLAs) or contracts, which include timelines for responding and resolving incidents based on some criteria, usually priority, as a function of impact and urgency.

**- Create an Incident Management Workflow (AKA An Incident Life Cycle):**

**- Operational incident management requires several key pieces:**

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/106635733/200485116-3fece66d-d694-4258-b22d-1a70d5667538.png)

A service desk is divided into tiers of support: L1, L2, L3, etc.

**L1:**
The first tier is for basic issues, such as password resets and basic computer troubleshooting. Tier-one incidents are most likely to turn into incident models, since the templates to create them are easy and the incidents recur often. For example, a template model for a password reset includes:
    The categorization of the incident (category of “Account” and type “Password Reset”, for example)
    A template of information that the support staff completes (username and verification requirements, in this case)
    Links to internal or external knowledge base articles that support the incident.
Low-priority tier-one incidents do not impact the business in any way and can be worked around by users.

**L2:**
Second-tier support involves issues that need more skill, training, or access to complete. Resetting an RSA token, for example, may require tier-two escalation. Some organizations categorize incidents reported by VIPs as tier two to provide a higher quality of service to those employees. Tier-two incidents may be medium-priority issues, which need a faster response from the service desk.

**L3:**
Correct assignment of tiers and priorities occurs when most incidents fall into tier one/low priority, some fall into tier two, and few require escalation to tier three. Those that require urgent escalation become major Incidents, which require the “all hands on deck” response.
Major incidents are defined by ITIL as incidents that represent significant disruption to the business. These are always high priority and warrant immediate response by the service desk and often escalation staff. In the tiered support structure, these incidents are tier three and are good candidates for problem management.

**6 Goals of Incident Management:**
The prime goal of incident management is to resolve incidents either with temp fix or perm fix and bring back the IT service. We list here a few steps involved during the incident process.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/106635733/200489784-54141cb9-0700-47d5-b530-459e91d2cfb5.png)

1.Resolve incidents to reduce downtime to the business
The prime goal of incident management is to resolve incidents either with temp fix or perm fix and bring back the IT service. Resolving the incidents firstly requires registering the incident in the ITSM tool with a unique reference number. Categorization of the incident is done based on hardware, software, etc., and then the incident is assigned to the appropriate team or a person to take quick action. The investigation and diagnosis are made. The resolution is implemented by searching knowledge articles or reference materials or KEDB, and once the issue is resolved, the incident is closed.

2.Improve the quality of IT service and increase the availability of the operation of the service:
Incident management can improve the quality of IT services by identifying the recurring incidents and logging problem tickets to identify the root cause of the incident/ incidents. If there is any recent incident with no resolution, then a problem ticket is created to identify the root cause and fix it.
By identifying the recurring incidents and their associated CI’s, availability management or capacity management or information security management, or continuity management can redefine or revise the respective plans and procedures to improve the delivery of services.

3.Monitoring of services, detecting and mitigating incidents:
As the incident management team in many organizations is also involved in monitoring, they will get a complete picture of why the incident occurred, what errors or warnings, or exceptions have occurred. Accordingly, the monitoring team can consolidate the complete information from monitoring and event management tools and inform the problem management team for quicker resolution of unknown incidents. 

4.Communicate regarding the progress of the major incidents to all stakeholders
The incident management team will communicate the major incidents' progress to the necessary stakeholders from the moment it has been registered to the closure.
The incident management team keeps sending notifications regularly after every half an hour or the defined timelines to all the relevant stakeholder giving information on the incident like:
 1. What is the incident?
 2. What is the priority?
 3. When the incident occurred?
 4. Where is the incident happening or happened?
 5. What is the associated CI?
 6. How many people are impacted?
 7. Who is working on the issue?
 8. Estimated time to resolve the incident

5.Ensure SLA’s don’t breach for any reason:
The incident manager and management team will have to ensure the SLA doesn’t breach any of the incident tickets for any reason like 3rd party involvement, negligence of the incident management team, dependency on any other problem, or change ticket.

6.Measure the effectiveness of incident management operations:
The incident manager has to track the effectiveness of the incident management operations by defining the metrics and KPI’s (Key Performance Indicators) like:
 1. Number of incidents
 2. Number of major incidents
 3. Number of recurring incidents
 4. The average time is taken to resolve the incident
 5. The average time is taken to resolve the major incident
 6. Incidents that triggered problem tickets
 7. Incidents that began change tickets
