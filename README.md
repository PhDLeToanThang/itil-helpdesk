**- Create an Incident Management Workflow (AKA An Incident Life Cycle):**

A service desk is divided into tiers of support: L1, L2, L3, etc.

**L1:**
The first tier is for basic issues, such as password resets and basic computer troubleshooting. Tier-one incidents are most likely to turn into incident models, since the templates to create them are easy and the incidents recur often. For example, a template model for a password reset includes:
    The categorization of the incident (category of “Account” and type “Password Reset”, for example)
    A template of information that the support staff completes (username and verification requirements, in this case)
    Links to internal or external knowledge base articles that support the incident.
Low-priority tier-one incidents do not impact the business in any way and can be worked around by users.

**L2:**
Second-tier support involves issues that need more skill, training, or access to complete. Resetting an RSA token, for example, may require tier-two escalation. Some organizations categorize incidents reported by VIPs as tier two to provide a higher quality of service to those employees. Tier-two incidents may be medium-priority issues, which need a faster response from the service desk.

**L3:**
Correct assignment of tiers and priorities occurs when most incidents fall into tier one/low priority, some fall into tier two, and few require escalation to tier three. Those that require urgent escalation become major Incidents, which require the “all hands on deck” response.
Major incidents are defined by ITIL as incidents that represent significant disruption to the business. These are always high priority and warrant immediate response by the service desk and often escalation staff. In the tiered support structure, these incidents are tier three and are good candidates for problem management.
